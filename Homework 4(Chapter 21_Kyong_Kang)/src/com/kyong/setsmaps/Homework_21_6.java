/**
 * Created by kkang on 11/1/2016.
 * (Count the occurrences of numbers entered) Write a program that reads an
 * unspecified number of integers and finds the one that has the most occurrences.
 * The input ends when the input is 0. For example, if you entered 2340354â€“3 3320,
 * the number 3 occurred most often. If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences,
 * all of them should be reported. For example, since 9 and 3 appear twice in the list 93039324,
 * both occurrences should be reported.
